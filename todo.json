You'll see blue dots on the page, I've set up some tour points to help walk you through each section, click on one and you'll see previous and next links to jump to the next point.</p><p>2. You can add your own comments and questions to the mockups. At the bottom right corner, you can click the comments text, it will activate the commenting view. You can add specific points and comments throughout the mockup.</p><p>3. To jump to the next screen, there are arrows on either side of the browser window. Also, at the bottom right there is a 9 grid icon which will pop up a thumbnail of each wireframe.</p><p><br></p><p>Comment on any sections or content that should change or be added. We'll respond back or make the changes for our next revision. Typically at this point, we try to take what we like about both and combine them into one wireframe. Or maybe one is the perfect direction. We can, of course, run through these during a call or the sitemap workshop and map out the direction we want to go forward with.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or want to jump on a call quickly to run through any of our thoughts.
